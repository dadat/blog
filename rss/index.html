<p>Since the only way to generate and deploy Ghost's static pages is with <a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster">buster</a>, doing it in Windows 10 is a pain in the ass; buster was not written with Windows users in mind.</p>

<h2 id="downloadingtheinstallers">Downloading the installers</h2>

<p>First you will need the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">Git Bash</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/download/release/v4.2.0/">node.js</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a> with version below 3.0</li>
<li>pip - installed with either <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/pip">chocolatey</a> or pip 7.1.2 <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/">here</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="theprocess">The Process</h2>

<p>Other people will have various ways of setting up their installation, so be sure to have at least a familiar understanding of command line and command line tools.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>

<p>For Git Pages projects:</p>

<p>Create a new repository called <strong>blog</strong>, add a branch called <em>"gh-pages"</em>. This will serve as your project page for Git Pages. It will look like <a href="http://username.github.io/blog/">http://username.github.io/blog/</a></p>

<p>Open up git bash and clone your repository:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/username/blog.git
</code></pre>

<p>Check to see if the installations were successful by typing in your command line:</p>

<pre><code>python --version
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>node --version
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>npm --version
</code></pre>

<p>If they output their respective versions, then the installation is complete. </p>

<p>Download <a href="https://ghost.org/download/">Ghost</a> and extract it onto your desktop. Enter the newly created folder and open git bash.</p>

<pre><code>$ npm install
</code></pre>

<p>Let ghost install its packages, this will be in a folder called <em>node_modules</em>.</p>

<pre><code>$ npm start
</code></pre>

<p>A local instance of your site will now be running on <a href="http://dadat.github.io:2368">http://dadat.github.io:2368</a>. <br>
Now you can play with the settings on <a href="http://dadat.github.io:2368/ghost">http://dadat.github.io:2368/ghost</a></p>

<h2 id="modifyingbusterforwindows">Modifying Buster for Windows</h2>

<p>Buster is a tool for generating and deploying static pages. It can only be used while you are running a local instance of your site.</p>

<p>Get buster here: <a href="https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster">https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster</a></p>

<h2 id="important">IMPORTANT:</h2>

<p>This build of buster is not compatible with Windows, here is a <em>buster.py</em> file which will fix routing and file name issues you might encounter.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/amphipath/buster/blob/d67304251484d148abcceb2018902c6a3f51b322/buster/buster.py">Link to file</a></p>

<p>Copy or download this and replace <em>buster.py</em> inside /buster/buster.</p>

<p><strong>Optional</strong>: </p>

<hr>

<p>If you wish to route your local git repository with buster, change directory into /buster/buster and open up git bash. Type in:</p>

<pre><code>$ python buster.py setup
</code></pre>

<p>Enter your repository's SSH link. It will look like this: git@github.com:username/blog.git</p>

<p>Buster will then create a folder called <em>static</em>.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you do not with to do this for reasons like missing dependencies or broken links, then follow the next step.</p>

<p>Make sure you have your local site up and running. Enter /buster/buster, open git bash and type in:</p>

<pre><code>$ buster generate --domain=http://127.0.0.1:2368
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate your local site into html pages inside a new folder called "<em>static</em>".</p>

<hr>

<p>If you have followed the optional step, then you may deploy your site directly into your github repository. Input this on git bash while outside of your <em>static</em> folder:</p>

<pre><code>$ buster deploy --dir=/yourfoldernamehere/
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>If you did not follow the optional steps, just copy and paste the contents of <em>static</em> into your repository folder and push onto GitHub.</p>

<p>Check which files have been added, open up git bash inside your repo folder.</p>

<pre><code>$ git status
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Commit message here"
$ git push origin gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>This will push all of your files into the gh-pages branch of your repository. Wait a few seconds for GitHub's servers to refresh and visit your Git Pages hosted site on: <a href="http://username.github.io/">http://username.github.io/</a><strong>repositoryname</strong></p>

<p>Enjoy your new site. If you have a domain, just look up CNAME and domains on google.</p>]]&gt;</encoded></item><item><title></title><description>I'm building this place to be my new Captain's Log.

"<em>Why don't I host my blog on it</em>?", I said. First one I tried out was Jekyll - written in Ruby, this thing had a ton of documentation ready for deployment. With one major problem:

<p>It is not native to Windows(which I am unfortunate enough to be using).</p>

<p>Next up on my list was Hexo. It had plenty of themes ready, and the community was alive, but I could not place my finger on what was bothering me about it. Installation was quick, although it seemed too easy. Easy is fine, but when you're on Windows, you will know that easy comes at a price.</p>

<pre><code>npm install hexo-cli -g
hexo init blog
cd blog
npm install
hexo server
</code></pre>

<p>A few minutes after installation, the problems had begun.</p>
